Hello, my name is Daniel Flynn. This is a documetn menat to test my sprll checker project. There were no other collaborators,
this was solely developed by Daniel Flynn. It seems that there were a lot of other people who did a spell checkeras well, so
I hope that my project isn't too similar to everyone else's. The purpose of this document is too test diffferent cases of mispelled words,
and to make sure that the program can handle diferent kinds of punctuation! Isn't that such a great idea? Thhere are a total of 8 spelling
errors in this document that need corrections.
